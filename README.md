# Lit Doc
**this gem hasn't been released yet**

This gem is a collection of Rake Tasks that make writing docs easier by
allowing you to write the docs inside ruby files.
It also makes documentation much less of a repetitive process.
That is done by using the Lit Doc code to generate the repetitive parts of the doc.
